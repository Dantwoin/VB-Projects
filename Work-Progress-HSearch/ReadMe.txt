I am currently working on building a program that models UAV searching for objects.  It will model the Ant Optimized Search formula. 

Future features in development:
- Terrian map
- AI check terrian as they search for object
- AI leave a 'scent' path to mark where they have gone.  
- AI leave a 'scent to mark pat from where they found the object back to the source platform.
- User places objects on terrian to be found.
